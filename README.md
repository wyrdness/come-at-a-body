# Come-at-a-Body

**Category:** CRYPTID (Fearsome Critter)  
**Region:** Forest and Lumber Regions  
**Status:** Folklore / Tall Tale

## Description

The Come-at-a-Body is a fearsome critter defined by its direct, aggressive behavior. Unlike stealthy predators or cunning hunters, this creature has one simple strategy: it comes straight at you. No hiding, no ambush, no strategy—just a relentless frontal charge toward anyone it encounters.

The name itself uses dialectical English, where "body" means "person" (as in "a body could get hurt" meaning "a person could get hurt"). The creature literally comes at a body—directly, aggressively, inevitably.

## Physical Characteristics

- **Appearance:** Varies by account
- **Build:** Designed for frontal assault
- **Strategy:** Direct charge only
- **Behavior:** Relentlessly straightforward

## Behavior

- Charges directly at targets
- No subtlety or cunning
- Cannot be evaded through hiding
- Relentless frontal approach
- Aggressive and direct

## Cultural Significance

The Come-at-a-Body represents **unavoidable danger** in fearsome critter tradition:

### Psychological Dimension

**Types of Threats:**
- **Stealthy threats:** Can be avoided through awareness
- **Cunning threats:** Can be outsmarted
- **Hidden threats:** Can be evaded through caution
- **Come-at-a-Body:** Cannot be avoided, outsmarted, or hidden from

This represents **inescapable danger**—the kind that cannot be cleverly avoided.

### Dark Humor

The creature's complete lack of subtlety adds dark comedy:
- **No strategy:** Just charges straight ahead
- **Inevitability:** You see it coming but can't avoid it
- **Straightforward:** Honest in its aggression
- **Name:** Dialectical bluntness matches behavioral bluntness

### Dialectical Naming

"Come-at-a-Body" uses older English/Scottish speech patterns:
- "A body" = "a person"
- Common in rural/working-class speech
- Adds folk authenticity
- Suggests oral tradition origins

## Psychological Function

The Come-at-a-Body may represent:

1. **Unavoidable risks:** Some dangers can't be cleverly avoided
2. **Direct threats:** Honest about being dangerous
3. **Fatalism:** Acceptance of inevitable hazards
4. **Stripped-down fear:** Pure danger without complexity

In dangerous occupations, workers face both subtle risks (widow-makers) and direct ones (falling trees). The Come-at-a-Body embodies the latter.

## Notes

**This is folklore, not cryptozoology.** The Come-at-a-Body was never intended to be believed but represents occupational folklore addressing direct, unavoidable dangers through dark humor.

The creature's name and behavior exemplify the straightforward, no-nonsense character of lumber camp culture.
